```

Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add @interledger/pay
```

## Guide

### Flow

1. Call **[`setupPayment`](#setuppayment)** to resolve the payment details, destination asset, and/or Incoming Payment
1. Add custom logic before continuing, or catch error
1. Call **[`startQuote`](#startquote)** to probe the exchange rate, discover the max packet amount, and compute payment limits
1. Add custom logic to authorize payment for maximum source amount, or catch error
1. Call **[`pay`](#pay)** to execute the payment
1. Add custom logic to handle payment outcome or error

### Pay an Incoming Payment

> Fixed delivery amount payment

```js
import { setupPayment, startQuote, pay, closeConnection } from '@interledger/pay'

async function run() {
  let plugin /* Plugin instance */

  const destination = await setupPayment({
    plugin,
    destinationPayment:
      'https://mywallet.example/accounts/alice/incoming-payments/04ef492f-94af-488e-8808-3ea95685c992',
  })

  const quote = await startQuote({
    plugin,
    destination,
    sourceAsset: {
      assetCode: 'USD',
      assetScale: 9,
    },
  })
  // {
  //   maxSourceAmount: 1_950n,
  //   lowEstimatedExchangeRate: 115,
  //   highEstimatedExchangeRate: 135,
  //   minExchangeRate: 110,
  // }

  // Verify the max source amount is appropriate and perform or cancel the payment
  const receipt = await pay({ plugin, destination, quote })
  console.log(receipt)
  // {
  //    amountSent: 1_910n,
  //    amountDelivered: BigInt(234_000),
  //    ...
  // }

  await closeConnection(plugin, destination)
}
```

### Pay an Incoming Payment via a Connection URL

> Fixed delivery amount payment

```js
import { setupPayment, startQuote, pay, closeConnection } from '@interledger/pay'

async function run() {
  let plugin /* Plugin instance */

  const destination = await setupPayment({
    plugin,
    destinationConnection: 'https://mywallet.example/bddcc820-c8a1-4a15-b768-95ea2a4ed37b',
  })

  const quote = await startQuote({
    plugin,
    destination,
    sourceAsset: {
      assetCode: 'USD',
      assetScale: 9,
    },
  })
  // {
  //   maxSourceAmount: 1_950n,
  //   lowEstimatedExchangeRate: 115,
  //   highEstimatedExchangeRate: 135,
  //   minExchangeRate: 110,
  // }

  // Verify the max source amount is appropriate and perform or cancel the payment
  const receipt = await pay({ plugin, destination, quote })

  await closeConnection(plugin, destination)
}
```

### Pay to a [Payment Pointer](https://paymentpointers.org/)

> Fixed source amount payment

```js
import { setupPayment, startQuote, pay, closeConnection } from '@interledger/pay'

async function run() {
  let plugin /* Plugin instance */

  const destination = await setupPayment({
    plugin,
    paymentPointer: '$rafiki.money/p/example',
  })

  const quote = await startQuote(
    plugin,
    amountToSend: '314159',
    sourceAmount: {
      assetCode: 'EUR',
      assetScale: 6,
    },
    destination
  })

  const receipt = await pay({ plugin, destination, quote })

  await closeConnection(plugin, destination)
}
```

### Units

[On Interledger assets and denominations](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0038-settlement-engines/#units-and-quantities):

> Asset amounts may be represented using any arbitrary denomination. For example, one U.S. dollar may be represented as \$1 or 100 cents, each of which is equivalent in value. Likewise, one Bitcoin may be represented as 1 BTC or 100,000,000 satoshis.
>
> A **standard unit** is the typical unit of value for a particular asset, such as \$1 in the case of U.S. dollars, or 1 BTC in the case of Bitcoin.
>
> A **fractional unit** represents some unit smaller than the standard unit, but with greater precision. Examples of fractional monetary units include one cent (\$0.01 USD), or 1 satoshi (0.00000001 BTC).
>
> An **asset scale** is the difference in orders of magnitude between the standard unit and a corresponding fractional unit. More formally, the asset scale is a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, â€¦) such that one standard unit equals the value of `10^(scale)` corresponding fractional units. If the fractional unit equals the standard unit, then the asset scale is 0.
>
> For example, one cent represents an asset scale of 2 in the case of USD, whereas one satoshi represents an asset scale of 8 in the case of Bitcoin.

To simplify accounting, all amounts are represented as unsigned integers in a fractional unit of the asset corresponding to the source asset scale provided, or the destination asset scale resolved from the receiver.

Since applications need to debit the source amount in their own system before executing a payment, this assumes they also know their own source asset and denomination. Therefore, it's not useful to resolve this information dynamically, such as using [IL-DCP](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0031-dynamic-configuration-protocol/), which also delays connection establishment.

### Amounts

Pay leverages JavaScript [`BigInt`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) for arbitrarily large integers using its own wrapper for strongly-typed arithmetic operations.

Amounts returned by Pay use these exported classes and interfaces:

- **[`Int`](https://github.com/interledgerjs/interledgerjs/blob/master/packages/pay/src/utils.ts#L38)** &mdash; Class representing non-negative integers.
- **[`PositiveInt`](https://github.com/interledgerjs/interledgerjs/blob/master/packages/pay/src/utils.ts#L193)** &mdash; Interface narrowing **`Int`**, representing non-negative, non-zero integers. (In this context, zero is not considered signed).
- **[`Ratio`](https://github.com/interledgerjs/interledgerjs/blob/master/packages/pay/src/utils.ts#L234)** &mdash; Class representing a ratio of two integers: a non-negative numerator, and a non-negative, non-zero denominator.
- **[`PositiveRatio`](https://github.com/interledgerjs/interledgerjs/blob/master/packages/pay/src/utils.ts#L326)** &mdash; Interface narrowing **`Ratio`**, representing a ratio of two non-negative, non-zero integers.

**`Int`** and **`Ratio`** offer utility methods for integer operations and comparisons. They may also be converted to/from `number`, `string`, `bigint`, and [`Long`](https://github.com/dcodeIO/Long.js/).

**`Int`** and **`Ratio`** prevent divide-by-zero errors and enforce the internal `bigint` is always non-negative. They also provide type guards for **`PositiveInt`** to reduce unnecessary code paths. For example, if one integer is greater than another, that integer must always be non-zero, and can be safely used as a ratio denominator without any divide-by-zero branch.

### Exchange Rates

Pay is designed to provide strict guarantees of the amount that will be delivered.

During the quote step, the application provides Pay with prices for the source and destination assets and its own acceptable slippage percentage, which Pay uses to calculate a minimum exchange rate and corresponding minimum destination amount it will enforce for the payment. Exchange rates are represented as the ratio between a destination amount and a source amount, in fractional units.

Then, Pay probes the recipient to determine the real exchange rate over that path. If it sufficiently exceeds the minimum exchange rate, Pay will allow the payment to proceed. Otherwise, it's not possible to complete the payment. For instance, connectors may have applied a poor rate or charged too much in fees, the max packet size might be too small to avoid rounding errors, or incorrect assets/scales were provided.

Since STREAM payments are packetized, Pay may not be able to complete a payment if, for instance, the sender and receiver become disconnected during the payment. However, Pay guarantees payments never exhaust their quoted maximum source amount without satisfying their quoted minimum delivery amount. Every delivered packet meets or exceeds the quoted minimum exchange rate (\*with the exception of the final one, as necessary).

### Error Handling

If setup or quoting fails, Pay will reject the Promise with a variant of the **[`PaymentError`](#paymenterror)** enum. For example:

```js
import { setupPayment, PaymentError } from '@interledger/pay'

try {
  await setupPayment({ ... })
} catch (err) {
  if (err === PaymentError.InvalidPaymentPointer) {
    console.log('Payment pointer is invalid!')
  }

  // ...
}
```

Similarly, if an error was encountered during the payment itself, it will include an `error` property on the result which is a **[`PaymentError`](#paymenterror)** variant.

A predicate function, **`isPaymentError`**, is also exported to check if any value is a variant of the enum.

### Payment Pointers

Pay exports the **[`AccountUrl`](https://github.com/interledgerjs/interledgerjs/blob/master/packages/pay/src/payment-pointer.ts#L13)** utility to validate payment pointers and SPSP/Open Payments account URLs. Since payment pointers identify unique Interledger accounts, Pay parses them so they can be compared against external references to the same account.

### Connection Security

Some applications may find it useful for multiple Pay library instances to send over a single STREAM connection, such as quoting in one process, and sending money in another.

In this case, the client application must track key security parameters, such as the request count, which STREAM relies on for monotonically increasing sequence numbers and secure acknowledgements of each request.

Pay uses a **[`Counter`](https://github.com/interledgerjs/interledgerjs/blob/master/packages/pay/src/controllers/sequence.ts#L6)** instance, passed in-process via the **[`ResolvedPayment`](#resolvedpayment)** object, to track how many packets have been sent. Applications that resume connections **MUST** use the counter instance to fetch how many packets have been sent, then create a new counter with the existing request count to pass to new Pay instances that use the same connection.

Other connection invariants applications should enforce:

1. **Only one** Pay instance (any actively running call to `startQuote`, `pay`, or `closeConnection`) can send over a single connection at one time.
1. After a connection is closed via calling `closeConnection`, those connection details may no longer be used for sending.

## API

#### `setupPayment`

> `(options:`**[`SetupOptions`](#setupoptions)**`) => Promise<`**[`ResolvedPayment`](#resolvedpayment)**`>`

Resolve destination details and asset of the payment in order to establish a STREAM connection.

#### `startQuote`

> `(options:`**[`QuoteOptions`](#quoteoptions)**`) => Promise<`**[`Quote`](#quote)**`>`

Perform a rate probe: discover path max packet amount, probe the real exchange rate, and compute the minimum exchange rate and bounds of the payment.

#### `pay`

> `(options:`**[`PayOptions`](#payoptions)**`) => Promise<`**[`PaymentProgress`](#paymentprogress)**`>`

Send the payment: send a series of packets to attempt the payment within the completion criteria and limits of the provided quote.

#### `closeConnection`

> `(plugin:`**[`Plugin`](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/deprecated/0024-ledger-plugin-interface-2/0024-ledger-plugin-interface-2.md)**`, destination:`**[`ResolvedPayment`](#resolvedpayment)**`) => Promise<void>`

If the connection was established, notify receiver to close the connection. For stateless receivers, this may have no effect.

The application must ensure the destination asset resolved via STREAM is the expected asset and denomination. |
| **`prices`** (_Optional_)          | `{ [string]: number }`                                                                                                                      | Object of asset codes to prices in a standardized base asset to compute exchange rates. For example, using U.S. dollars as a base asset: `{ USD: 1, EUR: 1.09, BTC: 8806.94 }`.<br><br>If the source and destination assets are the same, a 1:1 rate will be used as the basis, so **`prices`** doesn't need to be provided. It may also be omitted if the slippage is set to 100%, since no minimum exchange rates will be enforced.                                          |
| **`slippage`** (_Optional_)        | `number`                                                                                                                                    | Percentage to subtract from the external exchange rate to determine the minimum acceptable exchange rate and destination amount for each packet, between `0` and `1` (inclusive). Defaults to `0.01`, or 1% slippage below the exchange rate computed from the given **`prices`**.<br><br>If `1` is provided for a fixed source amount payment, no minimum exchange rate will be enforced. For fixed delivery payments, slippage cannot be 100%.                               |
